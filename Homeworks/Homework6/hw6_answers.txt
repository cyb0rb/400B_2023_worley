Homework 6

1. MW and M31 will experience 2 close encounters before their merger (3 counting
    the merger itself).
2. The relative velocities between the two galaxies are highest when
    the galaxies are at close distances, and lowest at the more distant "turnaround"
    points in the orbit. 
3. M31 and the MW merge around 6 to 6.5 Gyr. M33's orbit changes to a smaller
    amplitude and shorter orbital period around the resulting remnant. This is
    reflected in the relative velocity of M31 and M33 as well, with the periodicity
    in velocity becoming more regular and sinusoidal after the merger.
4. Decay of M33's orbit is about ~15 kpc per 1.5 Gyr (or 10 kpc/Gyr), so it would
    take about 7.5 Gyr for M33 to eventually merge with the MW+M31 remnant.
